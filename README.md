# 👨‍💻 Moubarak Ali-Kparah | Front-End Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases my journey as a developer, highlighting my skills in building modern, high-performance web and desktop applications.

**[Live Demo](https://moubarak-01.github.io/Portfolio/)**

## 📌 About Me

I am a results-driven **Front-End Developer** specializing in creating scalable UIs and extending functionality into full-stack architecture. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Electron** to deliver intuitive user experiences.

I am particularly interested in AI integration, working with tools like the **Gemini API** and **Whisper** to build intelligent, context-aware applications.
