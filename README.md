# 👨‍💻 Moubarak Ali-Kparah | Front-End Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases my journey as a developer, highlighting my skills in building modern, high-performance web and desktop applications.

**[Live Demo](https://moubarak-01.github.io/Portfolio/)**

## 📌 About Me

I am a results-driven **Front-End Developer** specializing in creating scalable UIs and extending functionality into full-stack architecture. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Electron** to deliver intuitive user experiences.

I am particularly interested in AI integration, working with tools like the **Gemini API** and **Whisper** to build intelligent, context-aware applications.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🤖 [Moubely (Desktop Assistant)](https://github.com/Moubarak-01/Moubely)
A stealthy, multi-model AI desktop assistant engineered with Electron for real-time screen analysis and audio transcription.
- **Tech Stack:** Electron, TypeScript, Gemini 3.0 Pro / Claude 3.7 / DeepSeek / Whisper.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Core Architecture & Stealth Logic:** Engineered a stealth desktop overlay using Electron with advanced window management. Implemented an aggressive "Ghost Window" fix using ready-to-show callbacks and a synchronized stealth toggle that hides the OS mouse pointer and protects the window from screen-sharing software.
  - **AI Integration & Evolutionary Routing:** Expanded the "Waterfall" system to an **18-model logic engine** that cascades across tiers (Gemini 3.0 Pro, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek) for zero downtime. Includes a history sanitization slicer and a vision-based "Solve" tool for automatic vision/text routing.
  - **Real-Time Audio Engine & Race Condition Handling:** Hybrid speech-to-text system using a local Whisper server. Features a ticket-based sorting system to resolve "race conditions" and ensure chronological transcriptions, plus a 1000ms cloud fallback logic.
  - **System-Level Features & Optimization:** Optimized footprint via RAM-based smart caching of student profiles. Refactored to type-only imports to resolve circular dependency crashes and integrated live terminal telemetry for real-time data flow monitoring.

### 🎬 [Movie Search App](https://movie-search-178fc6vic-moubarak-01s-projects.vercel.app/)
A reactive movie discovery platform featuring secure Appwrite authentication and intelligent mobile deep-linking.
- **Tech Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, AppWrite.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Rich Detail Display:** Designed a custom modal architecture to display detailed movie information (overview, rating, vote count) while preserving user context.
  - **Intelligent Streaming Routing:** Engineered a smart traffic routing system that detects user devices (PC/Web/Mobile) to launch native Android Intents or fallback to web streaming (Nkiri/Anilab), optimizing the mobile user experience.
  - **Performance & CI/CD:** Achieved fast loading via dynamic skeleton states and utilized automated pipelines via Vercel for rapid deployment.

### 🌐 [Personal Portfolio Website](https://moubarak-01.github.io/Portfolio/)
The source code for this personal portfolio, optimized for performance and accessibility.
- **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Performance Metric:** Achieved a perfect **100/100 Lighthouse performance score**.
  - **Interactive UX:** Custom **Light/Dark Mode** toggle, interactive animations, custom shine effects, and hover scaling on skill bars.
  - **Deployment Automation:** Automated deployment pipelines via **GitHub Actions** with custom domain configuration and SEO optimization.
  - **Accessibility:** Optimized with focus states, semantic HTML, and high-contrast colors.
